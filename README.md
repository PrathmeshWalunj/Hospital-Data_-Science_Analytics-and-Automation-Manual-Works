# Hospital-Data_-Science_Analytics-and-Automation-Manual-Works
I provide end-to-end data-driven solutions for hospitals to improve operational efficiency, increase patient acquisition, optimize costs, and enhance overall revenue. The projects demonstrate practical applications of Python, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Automation in healthcare. Automation also help us to automate manual work similar everyday. 

Key Projects & Highlights:

Project	Summary / Business Value
Staffing Optimization Model	Predict optimal staff allocation to reduce wait times and improve resource utilization.
Healthcare Cost Prediction (Per Patient)	Predict patient treatment costs to improve budgeting and financial planning.
No-show Appointment Prediction	Identify patients likely to miss appointments to reduce idle time and losses.
Marketing & Patient Acquisition Analysis	Evaluate campaigns, predict lead conversion, and optimize marketing spend using attribution models.
Length of Stay (LOS) Analysis	Predict patient LOS to plan bed occupancy and resource allocation efficiently.
Revenue Leakage Analysis	Detect areas where hospitals are losing revenue and provide actionable insights.
Operation Theatre Utilization Analysis	Optimize surgery schedules and resource usage for maximum efficiency.
Patient Journey & Drop-off Analysis	Track patient funnel from inquiry to admission, identify drop-off points, and improve conversions.
Hospital Expense & Revenue Dashboard	Interactive dashboards for management to track expenses, revenue, and KPIs.
Appointment Automation & Workflow Solutions	Automate appointment scheduling, reminders, and follow-ups to improve patient engagement.
